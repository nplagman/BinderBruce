# README

This website is/will host objective video reviews for products purchased from Amazon, many of which come straight from the Chinese factory floor.

Amazon has been ruined by the flood of overseas (ie from China) sellers trying to sling as much garbage at the highest margins as they can before the complete lack of quality control catches up with them.

If you think those 5 star reviews are from real customers, then I hope you're a fan of the return process.

Or, you can check out my site and perhaps I've already vetted the item you're considering purchasing. It's not all crap, just most of it. But even the legit products that are a decent bargain have the same fake reviews, the same broken Engrish, and the same deceptive pictures and intentionally contradictory product info.

Buyer beware, or go to the brick'n mortar (which often is cheaper, surprisingly, especially with home improvement items)
